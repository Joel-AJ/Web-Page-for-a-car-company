        <h2 class="about">About Divo</h2>
        <p>The Bugatti Divo is a stunning hypercar that pushes the boundaries of design and performance, crafted with the singular purpose of delivering an unmatched driving experience. Developed by Bugatti Automobiles S.A.S., the Divo is a limited-edition masterpiece that blends extreme aerodynamics with exceptional handling, embodying a new level of dynamic precision. Beneath its sculpted exterior lies an 8.0-liter W16 quad-turbocharged engine, identical to the Chiron, producing an astounding 1,479 horsepower. However, where the Divo truly shines is its focus on agility and cornering performance, with a re-engineered suspension system and lightweight structure that make it 77 pounds lighter than the Chiron, allowing it to conquer winding roads with extraordinary precision.
            Designed with a focus on aerodynamics, the Divo features an aggressive front end, a prominent rear wing, and extensive air intakes, all working together to create 1,005 pounds of downforce. This allows the Divo to remain glued to the road even at blistering speeds, making it a cornering monster unlike any other Bugatti. Its top speed is electronically limited to 236 mph, but the Divo’s true appeal lies in its agility rather than sheer velocity.
            Inside, the Divo’s cabin is a fusion of cutting-edge technology and opulent luxury, with high-quality materials like Alcantara, carbon fiber, and anodized aluminum. Every detail has been meticulously crafted to offer an immersive driving experience, from the ergonomic seating to the intuitive controls. With only 40 units ever produced, the Bugatti Divo is more than just a car—it is an exclusive icon of precision engineering, delivering an unparalleled driving experience that thrills even the most discerning of enthusiasts.</p>
