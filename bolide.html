        <h2 class="about">About Bolide</h2>
        <p>The Bugatti Bolide is an extraordinary track-focused hypercar, designed to push the boundaries of performance and embody the raw, unbridled power of Bugatti’s engineering prowess. The Bolide is powered by Bugatti’s iconic 8.0-liter W16 quad-turbocharged engine, delivering a mind-blowing 1,824 horsepower and 1,364 lb-ft of torque. Weighing just 1,240 kg (2,733 lbs), the Bolide achieves an astonishing weight-to-power ratio of 0.67 kg per horsepower, allowing it to accelerate from 0 to 60 mph in just 2.1 seconds and reach a top speed well over 310 mph, making it one of the fastest and most extreme hypercars ever conceived.
            The design of the Bugatti Bolide is entirely performance-driven, with every element optimized for maximum aerodynamics and downforce. The car’s ultra-lightweight carbon fiber body features sharp, angular lines and a low-slung profile, enhancing airflow and stability at extreme speeds. The Bolide’s X-shaped LED lights at both the front and rear give it an aggressive, futuristic appearance, while the massive rear wing and large air intakes ensure optimal cooling and downforce during track use.
            Inside the Bolide, the focus is purely on the driver and performance. The minimalist cockpit is stripped down to the essentials, with racing seats, a lightweight steering wheel, and digital displays that provide critical information. Everything is designed to reduce weight and maximize speed, making the Bolide a pure driving machine for the track. While luxurious touches are minimal compared to other Bugatti models, the craftsmanship and attention to detail are still unmistakably Bugatti, ensuring that even in a track environment, there’s no compromise in quality.
            The Bugatti Bolide is a limited-production masterpiece, with only 40 units set to be built, offering a rare opportunity for owners to experience the pinnacle of Bugatti’s engineering expertise. It is a car that transcends the limits of what’s possible in automotive performance, designed for those who seek the ultimate thrill on the track. The Bolide is not just a car—it’s a radical expression of speed, innovation, and the pursuit of perfection.</p>
